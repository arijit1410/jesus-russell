## Jesus or Russell? A State-of-the-Art<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Deep Learning Model

* A widespread issue in the 21st century is the confusion between [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), a prominent religious figure, and [Russell Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand), a British comedian and actor.
* We achieve an accuracy rate of **96.5%** by training a [resnet34 CNN model](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-visualizing-resnets-442284831be8) on 286 images of Jesus Christ and Russell Brand scraped from Google Images.
* Due to copyright reasons, the image dataset used for training is not shared here. However, URLs to images used are listed in '/Images/urls_russell_brand.csv' and '/Images/urls_jesus_christ.csv' respectively.
* This code is based on Lesson 1 of [course.fast.ai](course.fast.ai) 2019 -- acknowledgements to Jeremy Howard and everyone who makes the MOOC possible! :)
